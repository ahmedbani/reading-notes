# Markdown

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. 
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files.
- You don’t have to wrap it with tags
- Its not a WYSWIWG(what you see is what you get) editor like MS Word or google docs
- Instead it uses textual symbols to indicate a the structure of the page

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the .md or .markdown extension

here are some examples :  
- #This is an h1 tag in html. 

  ##This is an h2 tag in html. 

  ######This is an h6 tag in html.

- for an unordered list use (*,-,+) and the item.  
- for a ordered list just number it (1.).
  and then its autogenerated
- and there are much more.
