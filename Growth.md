The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, **so what is a growth mindset?**  
A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning and hard work.
