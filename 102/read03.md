What is **HTML**?

- Not wysiwyg. 

Why we use **HTML**?
- Build the structure of the webpage. 

How we use **HTML**?
- Wrap it with tags.  
- Opening and closing tags or enclosing tags. 

So as we sayed we use HTML to build the structure of the webpage, before you start building the structure you need to make a wireframe.  
What is a **wireframe**?  
Wireframing is a practice used by designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the design team.

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code. Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

After you are finished with wireframe,lets build the structure,   
the syntax that every html page should have :  
- <!DOCTYPE html>
- <head>
- <title></title>
- </head>
- <body>  
- </body>
- </html>. 

these are html elements and these (<>) are tags to wrap the contet for the machine to understand. 

in the head section we put:  
- the title which appears in the tab
- the links for css and js 
- information about the website. 

in the body section were we put the visual content,  we have three parts:  
1. header  
2. main.  
3. footer. 

now you can start building the structure of your website, here is a link where you can learn more about [html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).
