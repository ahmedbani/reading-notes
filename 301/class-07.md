# HTTP Methods

* **GET**
    * `GET is used to request data from a specified resource.` 
    * `GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.`
    * `Some other notes on GET requests:`
        * *GET requests can be cached*
        * *GET requests remain in the browser history*
        * *GET requests can be bookmarked*
        * *GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data*
        * *GET requests have length restrictions*
        * *GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)*

* **POST**
    * `POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.`
    * `POST is one of the most common HTTP methods.`
    * `Some other notes on POST requests:`
        * *POST requests are never cached*
        * *POST requests do not remain in the browser history*
        * *POST requests cannot be bookmarked*
        * *POST requests have no restrictions on data length*

* **PUT**
    * `PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.`
     >**The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.**

* **PATCH**
    * The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.
    * Syntax : `PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1`
