## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

> *Choosing a database depends majorly on the type of data that your project needs to store. If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.*

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

>**NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.**

## Give a real world example.

All big company like amazon have a huge database used to store all data.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

`The NoSql is best fit for hierarchial data `

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

    I think the NOSQL is the best because is less using the hardware all works did in server.

## What does SQL stand for?

> Structure Query language.

## What is a realational database?

> Is the access between entities and have specification roles.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

> Table , View Data , Insert Data.

## What is a ‘schema’?

> A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects

## What is a NoSQL database?

> NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

## Howo does it work?

like the object in JS by object name.

`For example: Last_name: "Jones", First_name: "Mary", Middle_initial: "S", etc`

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

>Mongo has data stored as documents which are then put into collections. A database can have one or more of these collections that have been formed.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

>While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? 

> NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
