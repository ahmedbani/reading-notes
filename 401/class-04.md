>Object stores its state in fields(fields represent the object stats),and exposes its behavior through methods.and data encapsulation It can't be accessed if it is private.

## Uses:

* Object 
* Class
    * Public
    * Private
    * Protected
>All of them depends on type of class.
* Inheritance
    >Using inheritance when i needed to access the parameter used in parent class but should have a public or protected data type and if it protected can't used in the main.
    
    >Or Inheritance we use it when we creat class need same fields or same functions.extends , class MyClass extends MySuperClass

* Package
    >Package allow to keep HTML pages in one folder, images in another, and scripts or applications in yet another same the folder in computers.
* Interface
