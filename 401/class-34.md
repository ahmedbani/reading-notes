# Monetization


## **Android Monetization:**
#### **Sell goods or services through your app**
When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.

#### Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system
Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content. Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

+ Virtual game products, such as coins, gems, extra lives or turns, special items or equipment, characters or avatars, additional levels or playtime.
+ App functionality or content, such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free version.
+ Subscription services, such as streaming media, digital publications, and social networking services.
+ Cloud software products, including data storage services, business productivity software, and financial management software.

#### Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay
Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

+ Retail merchandise, such as groceries, clothing, housewares, and electronics.
+ Physical services, including taxi and transportation services, cleaning services, food delivery, airfare, and event tickets.
+ One-time membership fees or recurring dues, including gym memberships, loyalty programs, or clubs offering accessories, clothing, or other physical products.
+ Electronic bill payment, including credit card bills, utilities, and cable or telecommunications services.

## **Other app monetization options**
**Advertising**

Get paid for showing Google AdMob ads, including native ads that allow you to match ads to your app's look and feel.

**Paid apps**

Set a price for your app that the user must pay before they can download and install it. You can also take advantage of automatic local pricing (or set prices yourself), promo codes, and pricing templates.
