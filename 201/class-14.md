## CSS Transforms

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the `transform` property.

The `transform` property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

### Transform Syntax

The actual syntax for the `transform` property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

```css
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

Notice how the transform property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. The un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite the prefixed versions, should a browser fully support the transform property.  
They are, however, strongly encouraged for any code in a production environment. Over time we will be able to remove these prefixes, however keeping them in is the safest approach for the time being.

### 2D Transforms

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. 

- 2D Rotate: The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically.
- 2D Scale: Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.
- 2D Translate: The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis. As with the scale value, to set both the x and y axis values at once, use the translate value and declare the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.
- 2D Skew: The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. The syntax is very similar to that of the scale and translate values. Using the skewX value distorts an element on the horizontal axis while the skewY value distorts an element on the vertical axis. To distort an element on both axes the skew value is used, declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.%p

### Combining Transforms

It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.

Using multiple transform declarations will not work, as each declaration will overwrite the one above it. The behavior in that case would be the same as if you were to set the height of an element numerous times.

### Perspective

In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective for each element can be thought of as a vanishing point, similar to that which can be seen in three-dimensional drawings.

The perspective of an element can be set in two different ways. One way includes using the perspective value within the transform property on individual elements, while the other includes using the perspective property on the parent element residing over child elements being transformed.

Using the perspective value within the transform property works great for transforming one element from a single, unique perspective. When you want to transform a group of elements all with the same perspective, or vanishing point, apply the perspective property to their parent element.

### 3D Transforms

- 3D Rotate: With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.
- 3D Scale: By using the scaleZ three-dimensional transform elements may be scaled on the z axis. This isn’t extremely exciting when no other three-dimensional transforms are in place, as there is nothing in particular to scale.
- 3D Translate: Elements may also be translated on the z axis using the translateZ value. A negative value here will push an element further away on the z axis, resulting in a smaller element. Using a positive value will pull an element closer on the z axis, resulting in a larger element.
- 3D Skew: Skew is the one two-dimensional transform that cannot be transformed on a three-dimensional scale. Elements may be skewed on the x and y axis, then transformed three-dimensionally as wished, but they cannot be skewed on the z axis.
- Shorthand 3D Transforms: As with combining two-dimensional transforms, there are also properties to write out shorthand three-dimensional transforms. These properties include rotate3d, scale3d, transition3d, and matrix3d. These properties do require a bit more math, as well as a strong understanding of the matrices behind each transform. 

## Transitions & Animations

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## Transitions

for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

### Transitional Property

The `transition-property` property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an element’s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

you can control :
- Transition Duration
- Transition Timing
- Transition Delay

## Animations

Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

### Animations Keyframes

To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the `@keyframes` rule. The `@keyframes` rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

```css
@keyframes slide {
  0% {
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
  }
  50% {
    left: 244px;
    top: 100px;
  }
  100% {
    left: 488px;
    top: 0;
  }
}
```

The animation above is named slide, stated directly after the opening @keyframes rule. The different keyframe breakpoints are set using percentages, starting at 0% and working to 100% with an intermediate breakpoint at 50%. The keywords from and to could be used in place of 0% and 100% if wished. Additional breakpoints, besides 50%, may also be stated. 
It is important to note, as with transitions only individual properties may be animated. Consider how you might move an element from top to bottom for example. Trying to animate from top: 0; to bottom: 0; will not work, because animations can only apply a transition within a single property, not from one property to another. In this case, the element will need to be animated from top: 0; to top: 100%;.
