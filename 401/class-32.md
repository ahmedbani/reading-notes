# Serverless and Amplify


## Intro to Serverless:
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity, isn’t it the ideal framework for that project you have been planning since a long time? Well, go ahead do it.


#### Serverless VS Traditional

+ Pricing: The winner here is Serverless Architecture.
+ Networking: The winner here is Traditional Architecture.
+ 3td Party Dependencies: The winner here is based on the context. For simple applications with few dependencies, Serverless is the winner; for anything more complex, Traditional Architecture is the winner.
+ Environments: The winner here is Serverless Architecture.
+ Timeout: The clear winner here is Traditional Architecture.
+ Scale: It’s a tie between Serverless and Traditional Architecture.


## AWS Amplify Kool-Aid:

AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services that can be used together or on their own, to help front-end web and mobile developers build scalable full stack applications, powered by AWS. With Amplify, you can configure app backends and connect your app in minutes, deploy static web apps in a few clicks, and easily manage app content outside the AWS console.


## GraphQL Intro:

The GraphQL Transform provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create backends for your web and mobile applications on AWS. With the GraphQL Transform, you define your application's data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model.
