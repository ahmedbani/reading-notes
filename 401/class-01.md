# Java Basics

## Variables

>In Java, there are different types of variables :
    
    1. String: "Text" => Array of character
    2. int: "Number"
    3. float: "Decimals Number"
    4. char: "single character"
    5. boolean: "returned true or false"

>**Syntax : type variable = value ;**

## Operators

Operators	        |	Precedence
------------------  |---------------------------------
postfix	 	        |	expr++ expr--
unary		        |	++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
multiplicative      |	* / %
additive		    |   + -
shift	            |	<< >> >>>
relational          |	< > <= >= instanceof
equality	        |	== !=
bitwise AND		    |   &
bitwise exclusive OR| 	^
bitwise inclusive OR|	|
logical AND		    |   &&
logical OR		    |   ||
ternary	            |   ? :
assignment		    |   = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

## IF-statment

> Using to compare between to falue of to fix the value is true or not. We can't show the body of if statment if the condition is false.

## For loop

>Using L[p To Fixed Or Check any thing many time like to fix an array if the value is even or odd.
*This is a basic Example:)*
