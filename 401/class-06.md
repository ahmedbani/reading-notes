#  Inheritance and Interfaces

## OOP

* What's Object :

        Software bundle of related state and behavior, It used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.

* What's Class :

        Blueprint or prototype from which objects are created

* What's Inheritance :

        Provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.     

* What's Interface :

        Is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface      

* What's Package

        Namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.

## Described the Parts of object : 

### Inheritance

- A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
- Excepting Object, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (single inheritance). In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of Object.
- Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on, and ultimately derived from the topmost class, Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes in the inheritance chain stretching back to Object.

### Interfaces

 interfaces are such contracts, In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces. 

 Defining an interface is similar to creating a new class:
```java
public interface OperateCar {

   // constant declarations, if any

   // method signatures
   
   // An enum with values RIGHT, LEFT
   int turn(Direction direction,
            double radius,
            double startSpeed,
            double endSpeed);
   int changeLanes(Direction direction,
                   double startSpeed,
                   double endSpeed);
   int signalTurn(Direction direction,
                  boolean signalOn);
   int getRadarFront(double distanceToCar,
                     double speedOfCar);
   int getRadarRear(double distanceToCar,
                    double speedOfCar);
         ......
   // more method signatures
}
```
- To use an interface, you write a class that implements the interface. When an instantiable class implements an interface, it provides a method body for each of the methods declared in the interface.
